# House Price Prediction
**Executive Problem Statement:**

The task was to develop and compare AI models, including linear regression and neural networks, to predict house prices based on housing features in a dataset containing approximately 20,000 house sales in Washington, USA. The goal was to identify the model with the best performance, justify its superiority, and evaluate its suitability for real-world deployment.

**Executive Solution Statement:**

- Data Preprocessing: Using a 70/30 split for training and testing sets with a fixed seed value

- AI Model Development: Evaluating five predictive models, including two Neural Network Models, Linear Regression Model, GRU Model, and LSTM Model.

- Report: The MLP Model 2 outperformed others across all key metrics: Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and Correlation Coefficient. Its accuracy, minimal error, and robust linear correlation position it as a reliable model for making decisions within the estate industry.
